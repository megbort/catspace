# Catspace

Welcome to Catspace! A place where cats can have their own social media platform. Think about Myspace... but for CATS!

This project was built for the sole purpose of getting more familiar with the Angular Framework.

I'll be continuing to add more and more to this project as time goes on.

Feel free to reach out if you have any comments or suggestions.

Enjoy!
